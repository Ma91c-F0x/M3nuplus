This is a software made for quick use and not for people just starting. If you wish to tak my code and make changes you
can, but don't send it out under the same name. So good luck.

1. Go into "commands.h" and change the username to your username.
2. Go into "control.cpp" find where it asks for your password and change that to your password.
3. Compile the code and run it.
